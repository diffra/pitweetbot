"Testing by itself does not improve software quality. Test results are an indicator of quality, but in and of themselves, they don't improve it. Trying to improve software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like trying to lose weight by weighing yourself more often. What you eat before you step onto the scale determines how much you will weigh, and the software development techniques you use determine how many errors testing will find. If you want to lose weight, don't buy a new scale; change your diet. If you want to improve your software, don't test more; develop better."

"well over half of the time you spend working on a project (on the order of 70 percent) is spent thinking, and no tool, no matter how advanced, can think for you. Consequently, even if a tool did everything except the thinking for you -- if it wrote 100 percent of the code, wrote 100 percent of the documentation, did 100 percent of the testing, burned the CD-ROMs, put them in boxes, and mailed them to your customers -- the best you could hope for would be a 30 percent improvement in productivity.

    - Scott Meyers

"Comparing to another activity is useful if it helps you formulate questions, it's dangerous when you use it to justify answers."

"Moving parts in rubbing contact require lubrication to avoid excessive wear. Honorifics and formal politeness provide the lubrication where people rub together. Often the very young, the untraveled, the naive, the unsophisticated deplore these formalities as "empty," "meaningless," or "dishonest," and scorn to use them. No matter how "pure" their motives, they thereby throw sand into machinery that does not work too well at best."
    - Robert A. Heinlein

"It.s so easy to become mesmerized by the immediacy of a result that you don.t question its validity."
    - Naomi Karten

"Every program has (at least) two purposes: the one for which it was written, and another for which it wasn't."

    - Flon's Law

"When one is postulating correlations or causations extant in reality, one should always remember that the human brain is mainly a pattern recognition engine. And it is such a persistent pattern recognition engine that it often perceives patterns where none exist."
    - Jeff Walther

"Any code of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else."
    - Eagleson's law

"If you can't be a good example, then you'll just have to be a horrible warning."
    - Catherine Aird

"Alas, to wear the mantle of Galileo it is not enough that you be persecuted by an unkind establishment, you must also be right."

"You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird... So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing -- that's what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something."
    - Richard Feynman

"Incorrect documentation is often worse than no documentation."
    - Bertrand Meyer

"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it."
    - Brian W. Kernighan

"If the lessons of history teach us anything it is that nobody learns the lessons that history teaches us."
    - Unknown

"The primary duty of an exception handler is to get the error out of the lap of the programmer and into the surprised face of the user. Provided you keep this cardinal rule in mind, you can't go far wrong."
    - Verity Stob

"If you want a product with certain characteristics, you must ensure that the team has those characteristics before the product's development."
    - Jim and Michele McCarthy - Software for your Head

"Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations. (For example, if you have four groups working on a compiler, you.ll get a 4-pass compiler")
    - Conway's Law

"It's not at all important to get it right the first time. It's vitally important to get it right the last time."
    - Andrew Hunt and David Thomas

"There are 10 kinds of people in this world....Those who understand binary and those who don't."

"The perfect project plan is possible if one first documents a list of all the unknowns."
    - Bill Langley

"Without stress nothing would move."
    - Bill Langley

"Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges and it causes end-user and administrator frustration."
    - Ray Ozzie

"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler."
    - Albert Einstein

"First, solve the problem. Then, write the code."
    - John Johnson
